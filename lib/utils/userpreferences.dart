    about:
        'Iâ€™m Giacomo Cappon, a Postdoc Research Fellow at the University of Padova. I received the MSc degree in Bioengineering in 2016 and the Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering in 2020. Currently, I am a postdoc research fellow funded by the Department of Information Engineering, Padova, Italy. My research interests mainly focus on the development of new decision support algorithms based on machine learning for improving treatment effectiveness in chronic metabolic diseases and the development of new digital health solutions for the efficient conduction of clinical trials. My research also includes Bayesian signal processing techniques for the analysis of continuous glucose monitoring. In 2018, I started collaborating with the Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology at the Imperial College London, London, UK where I contributed to the PEPPER project (funded under the EU-H2020 initiative). I am currently working in the BRAINTEASER project (also funded under the EU-H2020 initiative), and GLUCOMFORT (funded by the Italian Minister of Research under the PRIN 2021 initiative).',
